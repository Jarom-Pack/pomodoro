This is an extension meant to help people with a time-management system called the "pomodoro technique", where you switch between work and short break timers to help you:

-Manage distractions and control your time

-Maintain motivation

-Decrease mental fatigue

(For more information on the pomodoro system, read this article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

load in the extension files and then click on the extension in the top-right to access the timer and change things.

When the timer goes off, it will give you a notification.

While it's on the work timer, it will block popular social media sites.
